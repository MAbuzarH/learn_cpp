Open Source Crash Course
﻿

1. What is Open Source?
Open source refers to any program whose source code is made available for use or modification as users or other developers see fit.

﻿

2. Find a Repository to contribute
Finding projects on GitHub / GitLab is easy and challenging at the same time. You need development skills in any tech stack of your choice to get started with Open Source.

As per my tech stack, 
﻿cal.com fits best for me

Cal: 
﻿https://github.com/calcom/cal.com 

﻿

3. Finding the Perfect Issue
This is the first place where you start with your contribution journey, find the perfect issue from the "issues" tab which you think you can take up and start working.

TIP: Always filter issues on tags such as "good first issues' if your are just getting started out
﻿

4. Understand and Validate the Issue
After finding the perfect issue for you, make sure that you understand the issue and validate the issue that the problem really makes sense before starting with the contribution.

Always go through the entire discussion before jumping to making contributions

﻿

﻿
﻿cal.com issues: 
﻿https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/issues 

﻿

5. Fork and Start Contributing
As you don't have access to the original repository, you need to fork (copy) the repository to your account and start working on your copy.

﻿

6. Create relevant branches
Never work directly in the 'main' or 'master' branch, you need to create branches for each issue following the correct convention.

Bug - fix/<bug_name>

New Feature - feat/<feature_name>

﻿

7. Test Before Creating Pull Request
 are sure that you have solved an issue, make sure you test it properly before raising a PR, as creating PRs without proper testing code makes a bad impression.

﻿

8. Linking PR with Issue
Once you open a PR, make sure you link it with the issue you worked on by mentioning the issue number in the description of your PR.

Example:

fixes: #issue_number

resolves: #issue_number

﻿

9. Wait for the Maintainer to Merge
At this point, you need to wait for the maintainer to check your PR and be a part of the discussion if there is any. If everything goes right, your PR will be merged.

﻿

10. Repeat
That's it, Now just repeat the process by picking another issue of your choice :)
