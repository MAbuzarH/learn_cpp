Short Notes Polymorphism in C++:







 # *Basic Polymorphism Concepts*



1.  Polymorphism : Ability to use a single interface for different data types or classes.



2.  Virtual Functions : Functions in a base class marked with `virtual` to allow derived classes to override them.



3.  Pure Virtual Functions : Functions declared as `= 0` in a base class, forcing derived classes to implement them.



4.  Abstract Classes : Classes with at least one pure virtual function; cannot be instantiated.



5.  Overriding vs. Overloading : Overriding changes base class methods in derived classes; overloading is defining functions with the same name but different parameters.







 #  Intermediate Polymorphism Concepts



6.  Polymorphic Classes : Classes that use virtual functions to enable runtime polymorphism.



7.  Base Class Pointers/References : Use base class pointers or references to call derived class methods.



8.  Virtual Destructors : Ensure proper cleanup when deleting derived objects via base pointers.



9.  Dynamic Binding : Binding at runtime using virtual functions.



10.  Polymorphic Arrays : Arrays of base class pointers to hold objects of derived classes.



11.  Virtual Tables (VTables) : Compiler-generated tables to manage dynamic function calls in polymorphism.



12.  Virtual Functions with Default Parameters : Default parameters can behave differently when overridden.



13.  Final Keyword : Prevent further overriding or inheritance by using `final` on methods or classes.



14.  Covariant Return Types : Allow derived classes to return types that are more derived than the base class.



15.  Slicing Problem : Losing derived class data when copying objects via base class references or pointers.







 #  Advanced Polymorphism Concepts



16.  Multiple Inheritance : A class inherits from more than one base class; can lead to ambiguity.



17.  Virtual Inheritance : Solves the diamond problem by sharing a single base class among multiple derived classes.



18.  Templates and Polymorphism : Combine templates with polymorphism to create generic, type-safe code.



19.  Type Erasure : Hiding type information to enable runtime polymorphism with templates.



20.  RTTI (Run-Time Type Information) : Allows querying information about types at runtime (`typeid`, `dynamic_cast`).



21.  Type Traits and SFINAE : Use `std::enable_if` and type traits to enable/disable functions based on types.



22.  CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern) : A class template derives from itself for compile-time polymorphism.



23.  Concepts (C++20) : Constraints on template parameters for cleaner and safer code.



24.  std::any and std::variant : Hold any type or one of several types in a single object, enabling type-safe polymorphism.



25.  std::function : A polymorphic wrapper for any callable entity (function, lambda, etc.).



26.  Lambda Expressions : Compact, anonymous functions that can be passed around like objects.







 #  Cutting-Edge and Experimental Concepts



27.  Metaclasses (Experimental) : Proposed feature to define class behavior at compile time.



28.  Type Reflection (Future) : Introspect and manipulate type information at runtime or compile-time.



29.  Concepts-Lite (Beyond C++20) : Simplified, lighter constraints for templates.



30.  CRTP : Compile-time polymorphism using template inheritance for performance.



31.  Mixins and Policy Mixins : Compose classes from smaller components for flexible code.



32.  Modern C++ Coroutines : Manage asynchronous code with a more natural, sequential syntax.



33.  Tagged Dispatch : Compile-time selection of code paths based on type tags.



34.  Type-Level Programming : Perform compile-time computations using types.



35.  Non-Type Template Parameters : Use values (not types) as template arguments for compile-time logic.
